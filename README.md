E-commerce Product API
This project is a robust, RESTful API for managing e-commerce products. It provides a secure and efficient backend for a front-end application to handle product listings, user management, and advanced search and filtering.

üöÄ Features
Product Management: Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for products.

Product Attributes: Each product includes name, description, price, category, stock, and image_url.

User Management: Basic user registration and authentication for managing products.

Secure Endpoints: All product management endpoints are secured, requiring authentication.

Advanced Search & Filtering: Products can be searched by name or filtered by category, price range, and stock availability.

Pagination: Results are paginated to handle large datasets efficiently.

üíª Getting Started

Install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run database migrations:
